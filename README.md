# Liu Hui's Ï€ Algorithm
Developed as part of my school assignment, this program is intended to visualize Liu Hui's Ï€ algorithm. </br>
Built using Python, this project utilizes the Manim library. You can read more about it [here](). </br>
The video will be released on March 14, 2025 in celebration of PI day on Youtube. </br>

### Project Details
- [circleArea.py]() -> circleArea, circleAreaFormula, nApproachesInfinity
- [estimatingPi]() -> apothemFormula, dodecagonProcess, estimatingPi
- [liuHuiInequality]() -> liuHuiPiInequality

As aforementioned, this project is developed using Python. I've seperated functions into seperate files. </br>
To render a scene (ex: CircleArea), enter in your terminal:
```
manim circleArea.py circleArea -qh -p
```

Though this repository was made in the hopes that someone might find it useful while Manim, </br>
please do not reuse without permission. All code included is only meant as a learning reference. </br>
 
### Manim
"Manim is a community maintained Python library for creating mathematical animations." </br>
To my knowledge, there are two versions of Manim publically available:
- [Manim Community](https://www.manim.community/) (manim)
- [3b1b/manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) (manimgl)

For my project, I settled on the community version. </br>
if you're attempting to use Manim yourself, you should check out both versions.  </br>
However, I'd recommend getting started with **Manim Community** since it offers incredible documentation. 


### Author's Note
Hiya, thought I'd leave something here. </br>
Though this project was originally for my mathematics class, </br>
I thought it'd be a shame not to share it with the community. </br>

I'm quite proud of what I was able to accomplish, especially in such a short time span. </br>
The script + research took about a week. Development + rendering the animations took a day. </br>

```
-- Time Frame --
Monday - Relearned Python + figured out Manim Library. Developed the program and rendered most scenes.
Tuesday- Recorded all in-person scenes. Began editing.
Wednesday (4AM) - Completed Version 1. It's done!
```
Overall, the creation of the final video took three days (and multiple all-nighters). </br>
